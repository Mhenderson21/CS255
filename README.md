The client for the DriverPass project was Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company aiming to address the need for improved driver training. The client wanted to design a comprehensive system to provide online driver training, including classes, practive test, 
and driving lessons. The system is intended to manage reservations, user roles, be compliant with DMV rules, and be user friendly, and operate on a cloud base system.

What I did particularly well was addressing the concerns and needs of DriverPass, and provide them with needed diagrams to represent how the system should operate.

One part of the document I would revise is the Class diagram in the system design document. I would improve this because it was not written very well. 
Additional system expansion would be beneficial such as in the class diagram and sequence diagrams, building out another system demonstrating how DriverPass would better retrieve updates from the DMV.

User needs were implemented by being interpreted through a detailed interview of the clients wants and needs of the system. 
This involved understanding the different concerns that the client (Liam) wanted for DriverPass such as security, user roles, and system expansion.
Considering the needs of the user is important because it ensures the system aligns with the user's and owner's expectations. 
It is also important because it is how the clients preferences for the sytem are met as well as the operational requirments. This ensures enhanced user satisfaction, usability, and success of the system. 


I approach designing software with an open mind, and use comprehensive analysis techniques to obtain the clients requirements. In the future I will use techniques such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, 
and class diagrams to ensure the requiremnets are met and continued analysis is happening. Addionaly I will get user feedback before submitting projects so that I can refine the documents that are being presented to the client.
